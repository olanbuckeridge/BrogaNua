<h1><b>CA400 Irish Sneakers Application Blog</b></h1>

<h1><b> The Beginning </b></h1>

Thanks for joining me!

The project has started. I met with Gareth Jones a couple of times to discuss my project ideas and refined what I will be tackling.

I had my project proposals too where my project idea was approved last week and am ready to begin work.

The main focus over the next week or two is researching everything that will be going into the application so I can put together my functional specification.
<h2><b>Idea</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea for my app is an Irish sneaker based app. As a sneakerhead it is an area that I’m very passionate about. I am constantly getting messages off people I know and people off Instagram wondering where to get certain pairs of sneakers. I want to create an app that offers consumers a place to find their sneakers without having to crawl through multiple sites. I want to crawl the websites of Irish retailers for their sneakers and compile pages for different brands/ models. The app will show you wear the nearest retailer to purchase the sneakers you want and show you lowest prices. The app will be broken up into sections - Catalog, Hyped Releases and Community.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Catalog section will contain data scraped from Irish Retailers allowing one channel for consumers to shop for their sneakers.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hyped Releases will be the very limited sneakers that are raffled off and available through competitions. There is normally one or two big drops a month and unless you’re checking retailers instagrams regularly, you won’t know about releases. I want to ensure all Irish sneakerheads get a chance at these sneakers.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Community section will contain information about events within the community and to show off local creatives and talent.</span>

<h1><b>Functional Specification</b></h1>

I managed to get the Functional Specification completed by Week 10 - November 27th.

I discussed the draft of the spec with Gareth Jones and he pointed out some areas to add to and improve on.

It was a good feeling to get it finished as I put quite a bit of research into how the application would operate and I feel now I have greater understanding of the architecture and interface.

<h1><b>Setting up Gitlab - managing devices</b></h1>

![GitLab](https://olanca400.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/GitLab.png)


Last year for my 3rd Year Project, I used Windows 10 to develop my application and did virtually all the work on my desktop.

This year I have installed Ubuntu on my desktop and my laptop to allow me to work at home, in the library or while travelling.

I now have my GitLab up and running between the two devices and have started to work on the development. I have also setup a Dropbox to manage images/ files to help with maintaining this blog.


Exams are starting to get close and my focus is drawn to them but I decided to try and begin development as I don’t want to fall too far behind schedule.

![App Drawer](https://olanca400.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/App-Drawer.jpeg)

I started off by adding a basic app drawer to navigate between different activities. This allows me to further develop each section. I have been working on the Back-End trying to work on web scraping but it’s nice to take a break and see some visual improvements on the Front-End from time to time.

Although I am focusing on exams – I am going to try and commit 2 hours a day to continue developing on the application while in exam period as I don’t want to fall behind.
